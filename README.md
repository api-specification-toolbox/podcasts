# API Specifications Podcast
This is a repo for generating podcasts about API specifications, and possibly showcasing other podcasts that are relative to the space. Similar to other projects in [the API Specification Toolbox](http://api.specificationtoolbox.com/), this project will be run via this repository. Using GitHub issues to define each podcast episode, and schedule them.

We are just getting started with this and haven't even planned the first episode, and the process of producing and publishing them. Feel free to jump in and make suggestions via issues on how we can do this. Like other projects, I will jumpstart the episodes and work to flesh out the process, but encouraging others to step in and help make this a reality.

We are using this README to manage this project, and Github issues to manage the conversation and all of the work that occurs around defining all of the areas of this work. If you have any contributions feel free to submit an issue or a pull request on this project, or any other in the API Specification toolbox, including the toolbox itself.
